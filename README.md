# Edunova Lite

Edunova Lite is a lightweight academic management web application designed to manage students, mentors, faculty, and academic workflows in an educational institution.  
The system is built with a clear role-based structure and uses Firebase for authentication, database, and hosting.
This project is developed as an academic management system prototype for educational institutions.


The main goal of Edunova Lite is to simplify attendance, marks, and result management while keeping the system secure, scalable, and easy to use.
